## Project Overview

This repository contains `source.ipynb`, a Jupyter Notebook showcasing the use of large language models (LLMs) that i worked on during a very enriching bootcamp preseneted by Eng. Sulaiman Ureiga. 

## Project Description
The code in `source.ipynb` demonstrates:
- **Fine-tuning LLMs**: How to adapt pre-trained models for specific tasks.
- **Text Generation**: Using LLMs to create coherent and meaningful text.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assessing the performance of language models.
- **Applications**: Practical examples of integrating LLMs into projects.

Each section is designed to provide hands-on experience, with detailed comments and explanations.

Happy coding!
